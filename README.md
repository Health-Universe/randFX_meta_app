The web app performs bootstrapping for confidence interval estimation and produces plots in real time. 

Replicates the meta-analysis from Samaha &amp; Romei (2023) _Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience_. See paper for more details on the meta-analytic model and experiments. 
The user can edit the values in the table as well as delete and insert data. The plots and meta-analytic statistics will update auotmatically after any change to the table.
